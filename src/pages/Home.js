            <p>
              {/* The project is focused on creating an IoT platform for smart
              homes, allowing users to choose modules and configure pin settings
              on a microcontroller. Once the project setup is saved, it connects
              with the microcontroller via WebSocket for signal transmission and
              control, enabling users to manage their smart home devices
              seamlessly. */}
              A modular no-code IoT platform empowers users to create and manage
              IoT solutions without the need for programming skills. By
              leveraging a user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop
              capabilities, it simplifies the process of connecting and
              controlling smart devices. This approach fosters rapid prototyping
              and deployment, making IoT technology accessible to a broader
              audience, including non-technical users. The platform's modular
              nature ensures flexibility and scalability, enabling users to
              customize and expand their IoT systems as needed.
